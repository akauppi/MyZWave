# Preparation:
#   On Windows 10|11 (see README!):
#     - # plug in the Z-Wave dongle
#     - PS> usbipd attach --wsl -b 3-1
#
# Usage: 
#   $ docker compose up zwave-js-ui   # only launch ZWave-JS-UI
#
#   $ docker compose up     # Launch both Home Assistant and ZWave-JS-UI
#
# Note: 'version' within Docker Compose files is "bygones". Not needed.
